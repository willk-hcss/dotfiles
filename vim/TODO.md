# My VIm todo list

* `fzf-vim` (for buffers, tabs, etc)
This is a thing
* Intellisense/Autocomplete.  `COC`, `Omnisharp`?  `Deoplete`? `VimCompletesMe`?
  * Some sort of "Find Usages" solution.  
* configure vim-gitgutter to auto-refresh, or maybe just refresh on save.
* Comments, liasasdke `Nerd Commenter` from https://opensource.com/article/19/11/vim-plugins
* Surround
* Some sort of "Search In Files" solution, like mayhbe `ag` and `fzf` integrated, as proposed at https://alex.dzyoba.com/blog/vim-revamp/ or `ack` from https://opensource.com/article/19/11/vim-plugins
* A workspace solution, like `vim-workspace` or `obsession`
* Transition over to neovim
* Linting
* `lightline` status bar?
* `EasyMotion` inside of sentences.  I.e. `df<char>`, the f should use EasyMotion rather than just the default find behavior.
